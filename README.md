## Install
Just install it directly by pip.
```shell

## Usage
### Use as a command line tool
You can use this tool directly from the command line with the following command, just like lspci.
```shell
pypci
```
Please note that the command line entry for __pypci__ is created by pip, and depending on the user, this entry may not in the __system PATH__. If you encounter this problem, pip will give you a prompt, follow the prompts to add entry to the __system PATH__.

### Use as a Python Package
You can also use this package in Python, here is the demo:
```python
import pypci
pci = pypci.PCI()
vga_devices = pci.FindAllVGA()
nic_devices = pci.FindAllNIC()
```
More functionalities are under development.
